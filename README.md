just left the theater now and i’m pretty sure my mind's, like, still in that other world. okay so The Legend of Ochi - it’s like diving headfirst into a cloud of cotton candy that suddenly morphs into glittering shards of mythical chaos. or maybe that was the popcorn? idk, it’s all making my head spin faster than that time i tried to mix red bull and sleep deprivation... weird times. 

> the sound! oh god, it clashed and rose like a swarm of restless bees on a hot summer's day. they nailed that aura of foreboding magic. cinema speakers barely kept up. had to strain forward (back’s killing me) just so i didn’t miss the little whispers between characters. voices like leaves rustling but then someone lit a fire beside them. mesmerizing and disruptive. 

a girl runs through a crimson forest and i think someone dropped their phone. if you download the movie, turn your phone off. maybe this forest symbolizes something? possibly... something to do with life or adventure or choices. her resolve felt like those difficult crosswords everyone pretends they can solve at coffee shops. 

Ochi. they weren't the only things legendary around here, pretty sure the theater popcorn’s at least 3 days old? my jacket’s covered in kernel flakes. anyway the Ochis have this, i dunno, hypnotic yet creepy cuteness, like the mutant offspring of puppies and shadows. i seriously want one. like i wanted, desperately, to pet an Ochi while watching the movie at home on the couch, which reminds me - if you do watch the movie at home, just make sure your screen’s big enough to do it justice.

this one scene - was it a dream? - or did someone just need better storytelling caffeine? it blurred like my mind’s currently doing... visions of floating luminescent orbs glowing with infectious enthusiasm, yet somehow still menacingly watchful. sort of like that weird uncle who doesn't say much but is always there at family gatherings, just hovering, radiating silent judgment.

ahem... conveniently forget which part it was that drove me to tears. guys next to me snorted but i don’t need to defend tears, right? blame Ochi for that, not my misplaced sense of dignity. must deduce significance of colors, a vibrant tapestry only an artist’s mind could unravel. but there i was, trying, headache included.

wait, sidetracked... trying to express how it felt like leafing through an ancient storybook with pages of timeworn enchantments. that dusty scent of timeless tales. momentarily disorienting. thought i heard my phone buzz but it was just... theater ambiance?

//int main() { printf(hello world); return 0; } 
brain fart 101, mixed tabs? снова случайно. dklfjada, maybe Ochi planted secret seeds of code in my mind while I wasn’t looking. gotta rest my mental pathways for now.
